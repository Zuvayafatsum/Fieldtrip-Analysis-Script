# Fieldtrip-Analysis-Script
Data Analysis Script for Raw Data (Non-commercial Acquisition Device)
The script is a part of the total analysis code for my master's thesis in which I investigate the neural underpinnings of aggression in a go / nogo paradigm. The provided script is for the ERP analysis, however, the thesis also involves time-frequency analysis of the same data. In case of request, I can also provide the script for the TF analysis too.
